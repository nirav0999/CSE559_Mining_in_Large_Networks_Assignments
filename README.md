# CSE559_Mining_in_Large_Networks_Assignments

## Problem Statements
For each assignment, there is a problem statement consisting of 3-4 questions. There is a corresponding problem statement pd in each folder.
The basic layout of each assignment is as follows - <br>
Assignment 1 - Basics of networkx, Simple graph creation and implementation of HITS Algorithm from scratch <br>
Assignment 2 - Creation of a live Barabasi-Albert Model and implementation of PageRank Algorithm <br>
Assignment 3 - Problem on Decision-Based Cascades and implementation of exact and approximate betweenness centrality<br>
Assignment 4 - Link Prediction Problem with implmentations of common Neighbors, Adamic Adder, Jaccard Index and Preferential Attachment, Applications of node2vec and deepwalk and implementation of a graph convolutional network (GCN) using dgl library
<br>
## Source Code
In each assignment folder, there is a folder named 'src' which has all the source code in .py files. The name of the file is corresponding to the question in the problem statement.
